    <!-- index.html:  This file serves as the main HTML file for your web application..
    It contains the basic HTML structure and acts as the container for your React components.
     Inside the <body> tag of the index.html file, there is usually a <div> element with an id where the 
    React app will be rendered. This element is commonly given an id of "root", but it can be customized. -->
    
    
    <!-- index.js: This file is responsible for bootstrapping your React application and rendering it into the
      designated element in the index.html file. It typically imports the main component of your app and uses the 
      ReactDOM.render() function to render it into the HTML container. -->
      
      <!-- When you run your React application, the index.js file is typically the entry point that gets executed 
        first. It imports the App component from app.js and renders it into the designated element with the id of 
        "root" in the index.html file. React then takes control and updates the rendered components whenever there
        are changes.
        This connection allows the React app to be rendered within the designated container specified in the index.html
        file, providing a seamless integration of the React components into the HTML structure. -->
